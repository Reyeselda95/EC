Phase-shift oscillator schematic contained in "stabosc.sch"

Phase-Shift Oscillator
Tutorial Circuit (STABOSC)

STABOSC is a phase-shift oscillator circuit contained in the file
"stabosc.sch."  The output is peak detected and filtered; the mean DC level 
then controls the channel conductance of the FET used in one of the phase 
shift networks.

This design is a single page and non-hierarchical.  Markers have been placed
on nodes of interest so that they will be displayed when the data file is 
loaded into Probe.

Symbol libraries required:
	special.slb 
	source.slb
	port.slb
	analog.slb
	diode.slb
	opamp.slb
	jfet.slb

Model libraries required:
	linear.lib
	jfet.lib
        diode.lib
      
Package libraries required:
	diode.plb
        opamp.plb
        jfet.plb

This circuit can be simulated using the analog or analog/digital version
of MicroSim PSpice, MicroSim Basics, or MicroSim Basic+.  It cannot
be simulated using the MicroSim Evaluation (student) version.

This design can be packaged for layout.
