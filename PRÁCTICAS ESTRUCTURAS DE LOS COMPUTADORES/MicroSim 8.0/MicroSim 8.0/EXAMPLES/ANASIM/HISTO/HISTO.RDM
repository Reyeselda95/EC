This example schematic was created using bottom-up design:  the
filter stage was drawn first, and then the File/Symbolize command
was used to create a hierarchical symbol from the schematic.  

Let's look at how we might analyze this circuit using PSpice's
Monte Carlo analysis feature.  This is a fourth order Chebyshev
active filter, which is designed to have a 10KHz center frequency
and a 1.5KHz bandwidth.  The components were rounded to the
nearest available 1% resistor and 5% capacitor value.   In our
analysis, we will be concerned with how the bandwidth and the
center frequency vary when 1% resistors and 5% capacitors are
used in the circuit.

A typical application of Monte Carlo analysis is predicting 
yields on production runs of a circuit.  Probe can be used to
display data derived from Monte Carlo waveform families as
histograms,  part of Probe's Performance Analysis feature.

Since we are interested in varying the resistors and capacitors
in the filter circuit, we needed to create models for these
components on which we can set some device tolerances for Monte
Carlo analysis.  The breakout.slb symbol library contains
"generic" devices for just this purpose.  The resistors and
capacitors in this schematic are the Rbreak and Cbreak symbols
from breakout.slb.  We used the Edit/Model command to
create/modify the models for these components as follows:

.model RMOD RES(R=1 DEV=1%)
.model CMOD CAP(C=1 DEV=5%)

To analyze our filter, we set up an AC analysis.   The AC
analysis sweeps 50 points per decade from 100Hz to 1MHz.  

This Monte Carlo analysis is set up for 15 runs.  (Note that you
can get a better - more interesting - histogram distribution in
Probe with, say, 100 runs.)  The analysis type is AC and the
output variable that we are interested in is V(OUT).  Select All
in the MC Options box and Dev in the Vary box.

The goal functions used to calculate the bandwidth and center
frequency for each PSpice run as a function of the voltage output
of the circuit in dB were set up as follows.

For the bandwidth definition, we need to find the points where
the voltage in dB is a specified level less than the maximum
level, mark those X values (frequencies), and then take their
difference.  We can define the first point as "search forward for
the first point on the curve that crosses the specified dB level
less than the maximum level on the positive going slope and save
the point."  In search command syntax, this search function is

Search forward level(max - db_level, p) !1

Similarly, we can define the second point as "search forward for
the first point on the curve that crosses the specified dB level
less than the maximum level on the negative going slope and save
the point".  In search command syntax, this search function is

Search forward level(max - db_level, n) !2

The bandwidth of our filter is the difference between the two X
values:   x2-x1

The center frequency goal function uses the same two points as
the bandwidth goal function, but the center frequency is the
average of the two X values:  (x1+x2)/2 

Because the data file can become quite large when running a Monte
Carlo analysis and because we are only interested in the output
of the filter, we placed a voltage marker at the output of the
filter and requested Data Collection At Markers Only.  

To display a histogram of the distribution of the 1dB bandwidth
for our filter, we select Trace/Add... , click on the
Bandwidth(1, db_level) goal function, and select V(OUT).  We want
the voltage given in dB, so we modify the Trace Command to
reflect VdB.  We want the 1dB bandwidth, so we type 1 as the
second argument to the goal function.

If you want to change the number of histogram divisions, you can
do so by selecting Tools/Options and changing the Number of
Histogram Divisions.

You can turn off the histogram statistics by selecting
Tools/Options and clicking on the Display Statistics checkbox to
remove the X.

The statistics show the number of Monte Carlo runs, the number
divisions or vertical bars that make up the histogram, mean,
sigma, minimum, maximum, 10th percentile, median, and 90th
percentile.  10% of the goa1 function values are less than or
equal to the 10th percentile number, and 90% of the goal function
values are greater than or equal to that number.  If there is
more than one goal function value that satisfies this criteria,
then the 10th percentile will be the midpoint of the interval
between the goal function values that satisfy the criteria. 
Similarly, the median and 90th percentile numbers represent goal
function values such that 50% and 90% (respectively) of the goal
function values are less than or equal to those numbers.   Sigma
is the standard deviation of the goal function values.

Similarly, you can look at the distribution of the center
frequency of the filter using the CenterFreq goal function.

The new histogram will replace the previous histogram.  To
display both histograms at once, use Plot/Add Plot before
selecting Trace/Add.
