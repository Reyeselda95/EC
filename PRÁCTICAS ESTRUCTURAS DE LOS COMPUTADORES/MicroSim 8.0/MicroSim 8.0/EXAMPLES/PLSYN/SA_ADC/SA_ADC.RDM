This design will run under MicroSim PLSyn.  The text is written 
assuming that the MACH Design Module is present, but the design
can be fit into other devices if it is not.

Required Symbol libraries:

Here we have a Successive Approximation 12-bit Analog-to-
Digital Converter.  The counter, for example, is most easily
modeled using equations.  <Double-click on HB4 - the state
counter>.  The inputs and outputs are automatically defined;
all you have to do is type in the equations in DSL - a
hardware description language that contains all the standard
HDL features such as case statements, truth tables, etc.
Here we have a D/A primitive.  The good thing about PLSyn is
that it can handle primitives, DSL code, and 74xx gates, or
any combination of the three, all in the same design.  This
would be useful if you had an existing design you wanted to
turn into a PLD.

Now let's do a functional simulation.  <Analysis/Simulate>.
We have to do a functional simulation because we haven't
picked a device yet, so we don't have any timing.  The
software automatically splits out each DSL block and
compiles it separately; if you change a block, only that
block gets recompiled - not the whole circuit.

Now let's look at the results in Probe. <Tools/Display
Control/PLSYN/Restore>.  <Zoom in around 4us>.  Note that
the output of the comparator is 1V, which is as it should
be.  <Scroll over to around 9us>.  Here the input goes to
7.3V, and so does the output.  So, again, the circuit is
working as expected.

Now let's start PLSyn <Tools/PLSyn>.  It automatically loads
the file you have compiled.  <Edit/Constraints>.  You can
select from hundreds of different architectures, but
typically there are only a few you are interested in working
with.  <Device Templates/Devices>.  For example, let's
select the MACH110, MACH210, P22V10, and P900.  You also
have the option of selecting certain logic families,
manufacturers, and package types, but we won't put any
further constraints on the design.  With the partitioning
option, you could also set the maximum number of devices
into which you want the design partitioned.  <OK,
Edit/Priorities>.  What we have done so far is set the
constraints to find all parts that meet our criteria.  Now
we can set our priorities such as price, speed, or supply
current so that it will rank the top 10 solutions based on
these priorities.  We will leave price ranked as the top
priority.

<Tools/Fitter/Partitioner>.  Since the design was already
compiled when we did the functional simulation, the first
thing PLSyn does now is optimize the design, which compacts
the programmable logic into as few equations and nodes as
possible.  Then it goes through the fitting process, and
determines into which of the selected devices the design
will fit.  In our case it fits into one P900, 3 P22V10s, one
P22V10 and one MACH110, or other combinations.  Notice that
it can mix architectures.  Note also that it is sorted by
whatever priorities you picked, in this case price, with the
cheapest solution listed first.  You can pick the solution
you want to use <click on MACH110 and P22V10>, and the
specific part number you want to use <double-click on a
solution in the Solution Detail box>.  If you had chosen the
three P22V10s, each part could have been a different
manufacturer's part number.

Once you have picked your specific devices, you can go back
to Schematics and re-simulate.  It will now do a timing
simulation based on the devices you have selected.  All you
have to do is click Analysis/Simulate; you don't have to
backannotate.  If you choose to change your solution, just
highlight a different part in PLSyn and click Analysis/
Simulate again.  An important feature of PSpice is that if 
you have a solution that contains different architectures, 
PSpice will correctly handle the timing.  <Zoom in to see 
the propagation delays>.

The next step is to create a JEDEC file and then program the
device.  Test vectors are automatically added to the JEDEC
file if you have set them up.  Choose Tools/Update Schematic
to backannotate the schematic with the devices you have
chosen.  <Tools/Update Schematic> in PLSyn.  In Schematics
<Navigate/Next Page>.  The design is now complete and ready 
to go.
