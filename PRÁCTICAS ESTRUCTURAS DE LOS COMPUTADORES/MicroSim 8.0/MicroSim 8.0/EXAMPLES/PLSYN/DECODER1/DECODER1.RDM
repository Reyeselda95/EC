This file is the basis of the tutorial "Creating a DSL Block" that can be 
found in the PLSyn User's Guide.

The stimuli and global ports have been provided as a starting point.  You 
will then learn how to draw the block, create the DSL file and associate the
file with the block.

This example will work in MicroSim PSpice AD with the PLSyn option, 
or in DesignLab.

Required symbol libraries:
	Port.slb
	Source.slb

Other required files:
	Decoder1.stl - A stimulus file created using StmEd.
