* Stimulus for Digital Example FRQCHK.SCH
*
* Begin operation by pulling the INIT input "LOW" for a minimum of
* 40ns.  This will reset the internal state machine.   At a minimum of 1us
* after power-up, the reference frequencies (REFL, REFH) and the test
* frequency (FTEST) may be applied.   The MODE input selects the
* relationship to be tested:
*
* MODE=0 : f(REFL) < f(FTEST) < f(REFH)
* MODE=1 : f(REFL) <= f(FTEST) <= f(REFH)
*
* When you want to begin the comparison operation, bring the RUN input
* "LOW".   The circuit will monitor the inputs continuously, and set the
* output indications appropriately:
*
*         MODE = 0                        MODE = 1
*         ----------------                -------------------
*  SLOW=1  f(FTEST) < f(REFL)             f(FTEST) <= f(REFL)
*  OK=1    f(REFL) < f(FTEST) < f(REFH)   f(REFL) <= f(FTEST) <= f(REFH)
*  FAST=1  f(REFH) < f(FTEST)             f(REFH) <= f(FTEST)
*
* The ERROR output indication is set (1) whenever 8 cycles of REFL have
* been counted (after having asserted RUN), without having recognized
* one of the above conditions (SLOW, OK, or FAST).  This differentiates
* the case of FTEST being completely inactive vs. simply SLOW.
