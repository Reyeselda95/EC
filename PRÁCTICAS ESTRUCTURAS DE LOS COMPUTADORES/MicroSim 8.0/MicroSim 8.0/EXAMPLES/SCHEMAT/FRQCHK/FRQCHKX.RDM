Digital Frequency-Comparator
Tutorial Circuit (FRQCHKX)

FRQCHKX is an all-digital frequency-comparator circuit which accepts
two reference frequency inputs, and a test frequency input which is
compared to the references.  After initialization and start-up, the
circuit produces fast, slow, OK, and error indications.  These outputs
have markers on them and will automatically be displayed when Probe is 
invoked.

FRQCHKX is designed using hierarchical blocks for
the initializer (INIT block), cycle-detectors (PICD blocks),
state-decoder (SDL block), and error-detector (EDL block).  Most
parts are from the standard Symbol and Model libraries.  Custom
components and a stimulus file are also configured into the schematic
(see the Analysis/Library and Include Files dialog).

This circuit can be run using MicroSim's Basics+, MicroSim Plogic, MicroSim
PSpice A/D, or MicroSim Evaluation (student) versions. 

Symbol libraries required;
	7400.slb
	port.slb
	frqchkx.slb

model libraries required;

The operational behavior of this circuit is described, for the most
part, in the April 1993 newsletter article "Simulate an All-Digital
Frequency-Comparator Circuit Using PSpice" which is included in the
Application Notes Manual.  However, an additional view has been added
to this example for the SDL block, and is used as the default.  This
view, SDLXLE, uses a logic expression model to represent the random
gate logic.  It also utilizes the DECODER subcircuit contained in
"frqchkx.lib."

To view an SDL block representation other than the default:

1.	Select the SDL block on the schematic.
2.	Select Navigate/Push and double-click on the SDL view of choice.

To simulate and analyze the circuit with a view of the SDL block other
than the default, you must configure the translator as follows:

1.	Select Options/Translators.
2.	Click on the PSpice (or PLogic) entry in the Translators list
        box (if it is not already highlighted)
3.	Clear the View field and enter the name of the SDL block of
        choice, e.g., SDLX (gate-level view); click APPLY followed by OK.

You are now ready to run the simulator.

This example circuit is not designed to go to layout.  No package definitions
have been created for the custom symbols used in this design.
