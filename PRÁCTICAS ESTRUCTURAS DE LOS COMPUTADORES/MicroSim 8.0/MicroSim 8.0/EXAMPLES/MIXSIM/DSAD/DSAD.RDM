Dual-Slope Auto-Zero Digital Voltmeter Circuit

This circuit demonstrates the mixed analog/digital capabilities of the
simulator.  The design is a single page and is not hierarchical.  Markers
have been placed on the key input and output signals and busses so that
the traces will be displayed automatically when Probe is started.

This design can be packaged for layout.

This circuit uses ten analog switches (S1-S10), which are controlled
by the digital sequencing logic, to configure the analog section into
one of four modes.  The analog section consists of a voltage follower 
(U28), an integrator (U27), and a compactor (U1).  Using the switches 
these can be configured to: Auto-Zero mode, where the total effective
offset voltage of all three analog gain blocks is stored on the 
capacitor C1; Integrate Input mode, where the difference between the 
In_Pos and In_Neg inputs is integrated onto capacitor C3; Integrate
Positive Reference mode, where the Vref value (stored on C2) is 
integrated onto capacitor C3; and finally, Integrate Negative Reference
mode, where -Vref (stored on C2) is integrated onto capacitor C3.

The control logic configures the analog system into Auto-Zero mode for 
the first 8.3ms (1000 clock cycles) of the conversion cycle.  For the next 
8.3ms (1000 clock cycles) it selects Integrate Input mode.  Then it selects 
Integrate Positive or Negative Reference, depending on what the output of 
the compactor is.  The counter (U19, U20, U21, and U12) counts up the 
time it takes for the Integrate Reference mode to reach zero on the 
integration capacitor C3.  When the compactor output indicates that C3 is 
at zero, the counter value is latched into U25 and U26, which provide the 
output data values (D[12:0] and Sign_Neg).  The number of counts (divided 
by 1000) is the ratio between Vref and the input voltage.  In this example, 
the input voltage is 1.500 volts and Vref is 1.000 volts.

This design will not run under MicroSim Basics packages or the MicroSim
Evaluation (student) version.
