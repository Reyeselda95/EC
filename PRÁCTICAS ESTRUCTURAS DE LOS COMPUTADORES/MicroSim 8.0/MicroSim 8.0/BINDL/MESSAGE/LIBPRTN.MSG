& SECTION_NAME DEVICE
*The device that you have targeted in the .pi file does not have a subsection
*that corresponds to the given TARGET of one of the SECTIONs in the .pi file.
>Es prtn function cannot fit due to grouping needs
=        Function %s cannot fit due to grouping constraints.
& FUNCTION_NAME
*Placing this function in this device also requires placing a group of
*other functions, which could not all be placed.  This may happen because of
*user-defined grouping in the .pi file or because of pre-enable feedback
*restrictions.
>Es prtn pin not valid
=        Signal %s cannot fit due to invalid pin type.
& SIGNAL_NAME
*The user specified pin assignment places the signal on an invalid pin.
