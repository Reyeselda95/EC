"p1800.c
>E P1800 subgroup without target
=[33008]         SECTION inside a PI file DEVICE targeted toward a P1800 has no target.
*The P1800 device fitter expects PI file device SECTIONs to be targeted
*to a specific quadrant.  Valid target strings are "Quadrant A", "Quadrant B",
*"Quadrant C", or "Quadrant D".
>E P1800 unfixed subgroup
=[33009]         GROUPs are not allowed in a PI file DEVICE targeted toward a P1800.
*The P1800 device fitter does not allow GROUPs inside a DEVICE targeted
*to a P1800.  Use SECTIONs instead.
>E P1800 subgroup with ill-formed target string
=[33010]         SECTION inside PI file DEVICE targeted toward a P1800 has bad target.   Example legal target:  "Quadrant D".
*The P1800 device fitter expects SECTIONS to be targeted
*to a specific P1800 quadrant.  Valid target strings have the form
*"Quadrant <quadrant_letter>", where <quadrant_letter> is A, B, C, or D.
>E Multiple P1800 fixed subgroups for the same quadrant
=[33011]         Multiple P1800 SECTIONs in the PI file have the same target.
*There can be only one SECTION targeted to a given target.  If
*you really want both groups of functions in the same quadrant, then 
*combine the two SECTIONs into one.
>Es P1800 output signal wo subgroup or pin assignment
=[33012]         Output signal %s inside PI file DEVICE targeted toward a P1800 must be assigned to a pin or appear inside a SECTION.
& SIGNAL_NAME
*An output signal in a PI file DEVICE targeted toward a P1800 must be either 
*assigned to a pin or appear inside a SECTION.    An output signal 
*without a pin assignment would be ambiguous since the P1800 fitter 
*needs to know the quadrant you had in mind. 
>Esss Pin and quadrant assignments conflict
=[33013]         In P1800, signal %s assignment to pin %s conflicts with assignment to quadrant %s.
& SIGNAL_NAME PIN_NUM QUADRANT_LETTER
*The pin you are assigning to is in a different quadrant than the quadrant
*you are specifying in the target of the SECTION.  Please resolve
*this contradictory information.
