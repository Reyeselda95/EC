>W XORSOFT obsolete
=[7000] XORSOFT is obsolete and has been replaced by XOR.
*The XORSOFT primitive is no longer needed now that exclusive-or
*synthesis is supported.  If a device has a hardware exclusive-or
*it will be used.  Otherwise, it will be synthesized.
>W HIDDEN obsolete
=[7001] PORTHID is obsolete and has been replaced by NODE.
*The PORTHID primitive is no longer supported and will be replace
*internally by the NODE primitive.  This primitive will not be
*included in subsequent releases of the product.
>M Not included in subsequent releases
=  This part will not be included in PLDPRIMS in subsequent releases.
>F usage
=[7003] PLSchematic usage:  plsch design_name reader_flag
>F LOCK NOT INSTALLED
=[7004] Unable to validate product authorization.
*The code which prevents unauthorized use of the product is not allowing
*access to the product.  On a PC, either the hardware lock is not properly
*installed or the authorization code given via auth.exe do not correspond
*to the hardware lock and the product being run.  On a workstation, the
*authorization codes given in the license.dat file do not correspond to the
*host machine and the product being run.  See the Installation chapter of
*the manual for more on software locking.

*directory in the subdirectory orcadttl, or the environment variable,
*MINC_PATH does not include the path to the MINC distribution directory.

*netlist is consistent.  If it is not the error is printed and 
*processing is discontinued before the output files are generated.

*optimized out but is flagged because it is likely that the
*user either inadvertently left the component or forgot to connect
*it to the rest of the design.
>Wss no input pins connected
=[7023] No input pins connected to instance '%s' of type '%s'.
& INSTANCE_NAME COMPONENT_TYPE
