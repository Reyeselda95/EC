>Ess m5 section name not valid

& SECTION_NAME DEVICE

*that corresponds to the given TARGET of one of the SECTIONs in the .pi file.
>Es m5 function cannot fit due to grouping needs
=[35002]         Function %s cannot fit due to grouping constraints.
& FUNCTION_NAME
*Placing this function in this device also requires placing a group of
*other functions, which could not all be placed.  This may happen because of
*user-defined grouping in the .pi file or because of pre-enable feedback
*restrictions.
>M m5 attempt shrunk
=        Attempting to fit a reduced partition.
*Identifies an attempt to fit into an AMD Mach device after removing one 
*or more functions from the prior fit attempt.  The fitter may repeat 
*fitting attempts at reduced  partitions until a fit is achieved.
>E m5 failed clock routing
