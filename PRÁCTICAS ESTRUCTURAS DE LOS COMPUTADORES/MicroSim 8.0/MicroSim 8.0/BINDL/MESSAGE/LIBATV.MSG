>Ess atv5 device %s fctn %s too many univ pterms
=[12000] 	Device %s:  Function %s has too many universal pterms.
& DEVICE_NAME FUNCTION_NAME
*The function passes the check for total number of rows in the ATV5000
*series, but has more universal pterms than can be regionalized or 
*fit directly on the macrocell's universal rows.
>Ess atv5 device %s fctn %s too many signals
=[12001] 	Device %s:  Function %s needs too many signals.
& DEVICE_NAME FUNCTION_NAME
*The number of signals that the function requires in its control and data
*equations exceeds the number of signals available in the universal and
*regional buses of the ATV5000 series.
>Ess atv5 device %s fctn %s too many device inputs
=[12002] 	Device %s:  Function %s needs too many signals as inputs to the device.
& DEVICE_NAME FUNCTION_NAME
*The number of signals required by the function that must enter the 
*device through I/O and input pins exceeds the number of I/O and input 
*pins available in the ATV5000 series.

>Esds atv5 pin already assigned
=[12003] 	Signal %s .pi assignment:  Virtual pin %d already assigned to signal '%s'
& SIGNAL_NAME VIRTUAL_PIN SIGNAL_NAME
*Two different signals are implied to be assigned to the pin.  This may
*occur if there is a clock pin signal for the quadrant and a signal is also
*assigned to the clock pin, or if there is a latched unary function
*whose latch enable signal is different than the signal assigned to the
*latch enable pin for the quadrant.

>Edds atv5 unary pin input pin conflict
=[12004] 	Unary pin %d's input pin (pin %d) assigned to conflicting signal '%s'.
*The single signal input to the function assigned to the indicated unary pin
*must be placed on the indicated I/O pin, but cannot because another signal
*has been assigned to the I/O pin.

>Ess atv5 clock enable with clock by row
=[12005] 	Device %s:  Signal '%s' has a clock enable and a CLOCK_BY_ROW property.
& DEVICE_NAME SIGNAL_NAME
*In the ATV5000 series, when a signal with a clock enable is fit, the
*signal's clock signal is placed on the clock pin, and the clock enable
*expression is placed on the clock row of the IOLMC.  Therefore, it is
*impossible to honor the CLOCK_BY_ROW property when a signal has a
*clock enable.
>Ess atv5 clock pin signal not single signal
=[12006] 	Device %s:  Clock pin signal of signal '%s' is not a single signal.
& DEVICE_NAME SIGNAL_NAME
*In the ATV5000 series, the clock option may be used to implement a clock
*enable.  In this case, the signal that functions as the clock signal will
*be placed on the clock pin, and so must be a single, non-inverted signal.
>Ess atv5 clock pin signal inverted
=[12007] 	Device %s:  Clock pin signal of signal '%s' is inverted.
*In the ATV5000 series, the clock option may be used to implement a clock
*enable.  In this case, the signal that functions as the clock signal will
*be placed on the clock pin, and so must be a single, non-inverted signal.
