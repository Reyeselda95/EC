" mach fitter messages (some shared with m34 & m5 fitter)
>Esd mach Routing signals
=[24000]         Initial routing of signals through switch matrix failed: %s:%d.
& DEVICE_NAME DEVICE_NUM
*The current partitioning could not be routed by the mach fitter.
>Esd mach Failed to assign nodes
=[24001]         Failed to find suitable node assignment and signal routing: %s:%d.
& DEVICE_NAME DEVICE_NUM
*The current partitioning could not be placed and routed by the mach fitter.
*It could be routed with no placement considerations or placed
*with no routing considerations but no valid combination of placements
*and routings could be found.
>Esd mach Failed to generate fusemap
=[24002]         Failed to generate fuse map: %s:%d.
& DEVICE_NAME DEVICE_NUM
*A problem occurred in assigning pterm rows within the mach part.
>E mach OE Conflict
=[24003]         Cannot resolve OE requirements of macrocells.
*The fitter cannot satisfy pal block output enable requirements.
>Esd mach Function cant fit on pin because
=[24004]         Function %s cannot fit on pin %d because:
& SIGNAL_NAME PIN_NUM
*Mach function pin assignment cannot be satisfied for the reason(s) listed.
>Es mach Pal block demorgan conflict
=[24005]         Pal block %s cannot satisfy reset/preset requirements of all functions
*The pal block partition contains functions which are interdependent due
*to reset/preset requirements.  The inverted form of one function must be fit
*with the true form of the other, or vice-versa, however they cannot both fit 
*in an acceptable form due to cluster availability constraints.
>E mach Exceeds pal block enable limit
=[24006]                 Exceeds pal block enable limit.
*The combined pin assignments exceed the number of enable terms for a pal block.
>E mach Exceeds pal block pterm allocation capabilities
=[24007]                 Exceeds pal block pterm allocation capabilities.
*The combined pin assignments exceed the ability to assign product terms.
>Ess mach Signals use the same macrocell
=[24008]                 Functions %s and %s use the same macrocell.
& FUNCTION_NAME FUNCTION_NAME
*The named functions are assigned so that they require the same macrocell.
>Esd mach Signal cant fit as unary as required by pin
=[24009]                 Signal %s cannot fit as a registered input as required by pin %d.
*The signal does not meet the qualifications for a registered input (unary)
*signal, but the pin specified requires that the signal be fit that way.
>E mach Out of splitable pins
=[24010]                 Signal may require split pin; split pin limit is exhausted.
*The fitter budgets split pins (biput converted to node and input)
*based on the output (non-split pin) count for each pal block.  The
*fitter has detected that there are no more split pins available.
>E mach Hidden function with fanouts
=24011]                 Node assigned to buried logic has fanouts assigned to another device.
*The function cannot be placed on a buried macrocell because a fanout of the
*function is on another device.
>E mach It just doesn't
=[24012]                 Undetermined reason.
*The fitter cannot detect the specific reason why the signal cannot
*fit with other signals assigned to the device or pal_block.
>Esd mach Input cant fit on pin because
=[24013]         Input %s cannot fit on pin %d because:
& SIGNAL_NAME PIN_NUM
*Mach input pin assignment cannot be satisfied for the reason(s) listed.
>E mach Clock pin needed for clock
=[24014]                 Clock pin needed for clock.
*An input is assigned to a clock pin that must be reserved for a clock signal.
>E mach Biputs-as-inputs
=[24015]                 Biputs-as-inputs exceed pal block limits.
*The sum of inputs and outputs/biputs exceed the device/pal block limits.
>Ess mach Signals use the same pin
=[24016]                 Signals %s and %s use the same pin.
& SIGNAL_NAME SIGNAL_NAME
*The named signals are assigned to the same pin.
>Esd mach Function cannot fit on mach pin
=[24017]         Function %s cannot fit on pin %d due to buried register fanout constraints.
& SIGNAL_NAME PIN_NUM
*User pin assignments violate restrictions on Mach230 buried macrocell fanouts.
*Mach230 buried register fanouts must be within pal block pairs 
*(A-H, B-G, C-F, D-D).
>Es mach pin not valid
=[24018]         Signal %s cannot fit due to invalid pin type.
& SIGNAL_NAME
*The user specified pin assignment places the signal on an invalid pin.

>Ws mach Old Low Power Property
=[24019]    LOW_POWER property on signal %s obsolete, use POWER 'LOW'
& POWER_LEVEL

>Ess mach unknown power level
=[24020]    Unknown power of %s on signal %s in PI file.
& POWER_LEVEL
