" m34 fitter messages
>Ess m34 section name not valid
=[34000]         SECTION name %s is not valid for device %s.
& SECTION_NAME DEVICE
*The device that you have targeted in the .pi file does not have a subsection
*that corresponds to the given TARGET of one of the SECTIONs in the .pi file.
>Es m34 function cannot fit due to grouping needs
=[34001]         Function %s cannot fit due to grouping constraints.
& FUNCTION_NAME
*Placing this function in this device also requires placing a group of
*other functions, which could not all be placed.  This may happen because of
*user-defined grouping in the .pi file or because of pre-enable feedback
*restrictions.
>M m34 attempt shrunk
=        Attempting to fit a reduced partition.
*Identifies an attempt to fit into an AMD Mach device after removing one 
*or more functions from the prior fit attempt.  The fitter may repeat 
*fitting attempts at reduced  partitions until a fit is achieved.
>E m34 failed clock routing
=[34003]         MACH failed to route clock signals to pal blocks.
& PARTITION_LEVEL
*The partitioner could not accomodate the combined clock requirements of
*the pal blocks as partitioned (check clock polarity, clock pin assignments).
>Es m34 Clk signal must be on clk pin
=[34004]         MACH clock signal %s must be assigned to a clock pin
*The clock signal has been placed on a pin other than a clock pin
*but needs to be on a clock pin to clock one or more functions.
>Esd mach Failed to assign nodes
=[34001]         Failed to find suitable node assignment and signal routing: %s:%d.
>Es m34 power level mismatch
=[34005]    Power levels mismatch for signals in block %s.
& BLOCK_LABEL
>Ess m34 signal power level mismatch
=[34006]    %s  %s
& POWER_LEVEL

>Ess m34 unknown power level
=[34007]    Unknown power of %s on signal %s in PI file.
& POWER_LEVEL
>Ess m34 unknown slew rate
=[34008]    Unknown slew rate %s value %s in PI file.
& SLEW_RATE

>Ws m34 Old Low Power Property
=[34009]    LOW_POWER property on signal %s obsolete, use POWER 'LOW'
& POWER_LEVEL
