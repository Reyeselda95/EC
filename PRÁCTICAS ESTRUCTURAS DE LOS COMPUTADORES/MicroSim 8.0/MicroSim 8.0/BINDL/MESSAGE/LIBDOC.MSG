>Wss Name conflict in rename
=[13001] Signal '%s' was not renamed due to a conflict with signal '%s'
*The period character is not a valid symbol in the HDL. Internally generated
*names may contain periods however. In attempting to recreate a .src file, 
*all periods are converted to underscores. In this design, renaming the 
*signal caused a conflict with an existing signal name. For this reason, 
*the signal was NOT renamed. 

>Ws Name conflict in renaming array
=[13002] Array '%s' was not renamed since an element clashes with another symbol name
*The period character is not a valid symbol in the HDL. Internally generated
*names may contain periods however. In attempting to recreate a .src file, 
*all periods are converted to underscores. In this design, renaming the 
*specified array caused a conflict between one of the array elements and an 
*existing signal name.  For this reason, the array was NOT renamed.
