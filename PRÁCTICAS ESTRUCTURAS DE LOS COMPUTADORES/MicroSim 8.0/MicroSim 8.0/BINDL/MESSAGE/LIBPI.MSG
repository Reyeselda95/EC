*so cannot form a range.
>Ed pi index out of range
=[26072] Array index %d out of range.
*Only elements within the range of the array declared in the .src file
*may be referenced in the pi file.  An array declared without a left
*bound will be zero-based (e.g. OUTPUT a[4] will have the elements
*a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]).  An array declared with left and right
*bounds will have elements between and including the bounds (e.g.
*OUTPUT a[1..4] will have the elements a[1], a[2], a[3], and a[4]).
