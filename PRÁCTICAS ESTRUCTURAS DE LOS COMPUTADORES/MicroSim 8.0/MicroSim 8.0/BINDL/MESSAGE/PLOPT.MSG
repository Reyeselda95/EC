"main.c
>Ws Unexpected FF_SYNTH arg
=[5000] Unexpected argument for FF_SYNTH on signal %s.
*The FF_SYNTH property must be followed by AUTO, OFF, DFF, TFF, JKFF, or
*SRFF.  For this signal, this is not the case.
>F usage
=[5001] PLOpt usage:  plopt design_name
>F LOCK NOT INSTALLED
=[5002] Access denied to product
>F bad .afb file
=[5003] Bad .afb file.
*The .afb file is unreadable to the optimizer.  Remove the .afb file and
*rerun plcomp to regenerate it.
>Ws File modified after compile
=[5004] Source file '%s' has been modified since PLComp has been run
>F no system symbols
=[5005] The design has no system level symbols.
*Only system level symbols (those declared outside PROCEDUREs/FUNCTIONs) will
*become actual signals in the target devices.  If a design consists solely
*of PROCEDUREs/FUNCTIONs then there are no actual signals to implement in
*the target devices.  The PROCUDUREs/FUNCTIONs must be invoked at the system
*level to create an implementable design.  The optimizer generates this
*message when no system level signals exist in the design.
>Ms check error file
=CHECK '%s' FOR ERRORS.
&LOG_FILE_NAME
>Ms check warning file
=CHECK '%s' FOR WARNINGS.
&LOG_FILE_NAME
>Ms reducing
=   Reducing '%s'.
>F too many symbols
=[5009] Too many symbols in design.
>M synthesizing and reducing
=Synthesizing and reducing.
*This is the phase where register synthesis and equation reduction takes
*place.  For signal by signal reporting of activity, turn on the verbose
*option.

"collapse.c
>M collapsing declared VIRTUALs
=Collapsing declared VIRTUALs.
*This is the optimization phase where signals declared to be VIRTUAL
*in the .src file or in the .pi file are collapsed.
>M removing unused NODEs
=Removing unused NODEs.
*This is the optimization phase where signals that do not contribute to
*any OUTPUT signal are removed since they are not needed in the design.
>M collapsing equations
=Collapsing equations.
*This is the optimization phase where NODEs are either collapsed or made
*into PHYSICAL NODEs.  This is controlled by the optimizer equation
*properties specified in the .pi file.
>Fs combinatorial feedback
=[5015] Combinatorial feedback collapsing '%s'.
*The collapsing of signals involved in combinatorial feedback is postponed
*until this phase.
&*
>Ms collapsing symbol
=   Collapsing '%s'.
>Ms removing symbol
=   Removing '%s'.
>Ms making physical
=   Making '%s' be PHYSICAL NODE.
>Ws symbol not used
=[5020] Symbol '%s' not used by any OUTPUT.
*The means that a signal is not needed to drive the value of any OUTPUTs
*in the design.  This signal is not necessary to the design.
>Ws symbol has constant equation
=[5021] Symbol '%s' has a constant equation.

" factor.c
>M factoring
=Factoring.
>Md need factoring
=   %d symbols need factoring.
>M creating kernels
=   Creating kernels.
>M extracting kernels
=   Extracting kernels.
>M rating factors
=   Rating factors.
>Ms creating factor
=   Creating factor '%s'.
>Ws unable to factor
=[5028] Unable to fully factor '%s'.

>Fd maximum equations exceeded
=[5029] Exceeded number of equations for this product exceeded: %d
